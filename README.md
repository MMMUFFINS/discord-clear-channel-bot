# discord-clear-channel-bot

Discord bot to clear a channel.

Only works in server channels (not DMs).

# Permissions

Requires permissions to manage messages in the channel.

# Usage

Type the command message:

```
!delet
```

The bot continuously deletes any non-pinned messages in the channel until none are left.

Currently there is no way to stop it other than kicking it out of the channel.

# Todo

* Implement a stop feature.
* Use something that isn't Javascript.
